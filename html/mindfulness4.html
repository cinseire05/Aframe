<p>The quote of the day is “if you stay ready you won't have to get ready.” It means that if you are already together you don't have to rush to get it done. This could be very important because if you already have something prepared you won't have to worry later.

<p>It's good to stay prepared because if you prepared you don't need to worry about anything later. If you aren’t prepared you could be losing opportunities in life. By staying prepared your being ahead of the game and you got yourself together.
