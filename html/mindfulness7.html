<p>If you make a man feel that he is inferior, you do not have to compel him to accept an inferior status, for he will seek it himself. If you make a man think that he is justly an outcast, you do not have to order him to the back door. He will go without being told, and if there is no back door, his very nature will demand one.‚Äù by Carter G. Woodson. This is saying that if you make somebody feel lower than you they will believe it and become whatever they think of there self.
